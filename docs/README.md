# Random TV Show

This app is designed to produce a random episode of a specified tv show.

The user can set a main directory to serve as the root for all their videos, and then select folders within that directory for the app to choose from. The user can select to **Autoplay** videos, which sets a timer for the length of the video. When the video ends, a new random video is played.

The **Online** tab allows the user to select from a list of online shows, and clicking **Go** opens a new browser tab containing a random episode taken from the selected shows.

Additionally, in the settings a user can set two folders as their shortcut folders. Once these shortcuts are set the user can press `Ctrl+1` or `Ctrl+2` to launch a random video from those folders.
