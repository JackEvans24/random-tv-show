# Random TV Show

This app is designed to produce a random episode of a specified tv show.

The user can set a main directory to serve as the root for all their videos, and then select folders within that directory for the app to choose from. The user can select to "Autoplay" videos, which sets a timer for the length of the video. When the video ends, a new random video is played.

The second tab allows the user to select from a list of online shows, and clicking go opens a new browser tab containing a random episode taken from the selected shows.

Additionally, in the settings a user can set two folders as their shortcut folders. Once these shortcuts are set the user can press `Ctrl+1` or `Ctrl+2` to launch a random video from those folders. 

## The future

I have a few features I'd like to add in the near future which each have an issue against them. Anything I'm working on or will be working on in future is stored there, meaning the issues section is more of a bugs and features section.
